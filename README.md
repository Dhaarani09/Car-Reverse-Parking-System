# Car Reverse Parking System

This project is a simple reverse parking system for cars that uses an Arduino board and a PIR sensor to detect the proximity of the car to an obstacle (e.g., a wall or another vehicle). The system provides feedback using a buzzer and an LED, alerting the driver when the car is too close to the obstacle.

## Features

- **Proximity Detection**: Uses a PIR sensor to measure the distance between the car and an obstacle.
- **Auditory Alert**: A buzzer sounds when the car gets too close to an obstacle, with the frequency increasing as the car approaches the obstacle.
- **Visual Alert**: An LED lights up when the car is near an obstacle, providing a visual warning.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Board**: The brain of the system, processing sensor data and controlling the outputs.
- **PIR Sensor**: Detects the proximity of the car to an obstacle.
- **Buzzer**: Sounds an alarm when the car is close to the obstacle.
- **LED**: Lights up to provide a visual warning when the car is near the obstacle.
- **Jumper Wires**: Connects all components together.
- **Breadboard**: For easy prototyping and assembly.

## Usage

- Once the system is powered on and assembled, the PIR sensor will start detecting the distance to an obstacle.
- The LED will light up and the buzzer will sound as the car gets closer to the obstacle.
